          Items To Recycle To Save Our Planet

          Disposable waste is bad for the environment, plain and simple. Most of the products we purchase come with packaging and materials that end up in landfills, or worse (like the stomachs of wildlife or our water sources). Sometimes the over-reliance on recycling encourages people to live less sustainably. Even though the main purpose of a recycling program is to reduce or eliminate waste.

          Despite this problem, there are still many environmental benefits of recycling. CleanRiver recycling solutions has over 30 years of experience helping our clients improve their recycling habits. Sometimes it’s as simple as teaching people which items are recyclable

The whole point of recycling recycling is to help the environment and reduce resource consumption. So what better way to save sand than to conserve it via glass recycling? It’s also one of the easier materials to recycle! Don’t throw out those empty beer bottles."

That doesn’t mean batteries can’t be recycled though. The chemicals that can leak out of them are extremely harmful to the planet, and can contaminate other waste that would otherwise be recyclable. Therefore they need to be recycled separately from all other forms of waste."

That being said, the environmental benefits of recycling biodegradable waste (like food) in a specific container is worthwhile. Making compost is simple, all it requires is an organic waste bin and time. Then that compost can be used for planting, gardening, and more! "
